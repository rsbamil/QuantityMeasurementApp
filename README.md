- Uses `Double.compare()` for precision
- Null-safe and type-safe implementation
- Separate methods for Feet and Inches comparison

---

## Project Structure
- `QuantityMeasurementApp`
  - Static methods for equality checks
- `Feet` class
- `Inches` class

---

## Working Flow
1. The main method calls:
   - Feet equality method
   - Inches equality method  
2. Values are validated to ensure they are numeric  
3. Objects of Feet/Inches are created  
4. `equals()` method is invoked  
5. Result (`true` / `false`) is returned  

---

## Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation & Immutability
- Method Overriding (`equals()`)
- Floating-point comparison using `Double.compare()`
- Null handling and type safety

---

## Test Scenarios
- ✔️ Same values should return true  
- ✔️ Different values should return false  
- ✔️ Null comparison should return false  
- ✔️ Same reference should return true  
- ✔️ Non-numeric input handling  

---

## Example

**Input:**  
1.0 inch and 1.0 inch  

**Output:**  
Equal (true)  

**Input:**  
1.0 ft and 1.0 ft  

**Output:**  
Equal (true)

---

## Limitation (Current Design)
The current implementation uses **separate Feet and Inches classes**, which leads to code duplication:

- Same constructor logic  
- Same `equals()` implementation  
- Same structure  

This violates the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle.

---

## Suggested Improvement
To improve the design:
- Use a **generic `Quantity` class**
- Add a **unit type parameter (Feet/Inches)**
- Centralize equality logic  

This will:
- Reduce duplication  
- Improve maintainability  
- Make the system scalable for future units  

---

## Conclusion
UC2 enhances the application by supporting multiple measurement types while maintaining robust equality checks.  
It also highlights the need for better design patterns to avoid redundancy in future use cases.

# Quantity Measurement App – UC8: Refactoring Unit Enum to Standalone with Conversion Responsibility
## Overview
UC8 refactors the design from UC1–UC7 to overcome the disadvantage of embedding the `LengthUnit` enum within the `QuantityLength` class.  
The `LengthUnit` enum is extracted into a **standalone, top-level class** and assigned full responsibility for managing conversions to and from the base unit.

---
## Objective
To:
- Extract `LengthUnit` into a standalone top-level enum class  
- Assign conversion responsibility to `LengthUnit`  
- Simplify `QuantityLength` by delegating all conversion logic  
- Eliminate circular dependency risk across measurement categories  
- Maintain full backward compatibility with UC1–UC7  

---
## Features
- `LengthUnit` as a standalone enum with `convertToBaseUnit()` and `convertFromBaseUnit()` methods  
- `QuantityLength` simplified to focus solely on comparison and arithmetic  
- All unit combinations supported: Feet, Inches, Yards, Centimeters  
- Backward compatible — no client code changes required  
- Scalable pattern for future measurement categories (Weight, Volume, Temperature)  

---
## Project Structure
- `LengthUnit` – Standalone enum with conversion factors and conversion methods  
- `QuantityLength` – Simplified class focused on comparison and arithmetic  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Demo methods using refactored design  

---
## Working Flow
1. `LengthUnit` is extracted to a top-level standalone enum  
2. Conversion factors defined as constants in `LengthUnit`  
3. `convertToBaseUnit(value)` converts a value in this unit → feet  
4. `convertFromBaseUnit(baseValue)` converts feet → this unit  
5. `QuantityLength` delegates all conversion calls to `LengthUnit` methods  
6. All existing operations (equality, conversion, addition) work identically  

---
## Conversion Logic

| Unit         | Conversion Factor (to feet) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| FEET         | 1.0                         |
| INCHES       | 1/12 ≈ 0.0833               |
| YARDS        | 3.0                         |
| CENTIMETERS  | 1/30.48 ≈ 0.0328            |

---
## Example

**Input:**  
`LengthUnit.INCHES.convertToBaseUnit(12.0)`  
**Output:**  
`1.0` (feet)

**Input:**  
`LengthUnit.INCHES.convertFromBaseUnit(1.0)`  
**Output:**  
`12.0` (inches)

**Input:**  
`Quantity(1.0, FEET).convertTo(INCHES)`  
**Output:**  
`Quantity(12.0, INCHES)`

**Input:**  
`Quantity(1.0, FEET).add(Quantity(12.0, INCHES), FEET)`  
**Output:**  
`Quantity(2.0, FEET)`

**Input:**  
`Quantity(36.0, INCHES).equals(Quantity(1.0, YARDS))`  
**Output:**  
`true`

**Input:**  
`Quantity(2.54, CENTIMETERS).convertTo(INCHES)`  
**Output:**  
`Quantity(~1.0, INCHES)`

---
## Concepts Used
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- `LengthUnit` handles conversions  
- `QuantityLength` handles comparison and arithmetic  

### Separation of Concerns
- Unit-specific logic isolated in `LengthUnit`  
- Domain logic isolated in `QuantityLength`  

### Delegation Pattern
- `QuantityLength` delegates via `unit.convertToBaseUnit()` and `unit.convertFromBaseUnit()`  

### Circular Dependency Elimination
- Extracting `LengthUnit` prevents cross-category circular references  

### Encapsulation
- Conversion formulas hidden within `LengthUnit` — external classes use public API only  

### Scalability Pattern
- Template established for `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit`, `TemperatureUnit`  

### Java Enum Capabilities
- Enums encapsulate data (conversion factors) and behavior (conversion methods)  
- Inherently immutable and thread-safe  

### Refactoring Best Practices
- Functionality preserved while improving internal structure  
- Backward compatibility maintained throughout  

---
## Refactoring Steps

### Step 1 – Extract LengthUnit as Standalone Enum
- Move `LengthUnit` from inside `QuantityLength` to top-level class  
- Retain all constants: `FEET`, `INCHES`, `YARDS`, `CENTIMETERS`  
- Add `convertToBaseUnit(double value)` method  
- Add `convertFromBaseUnit(double baseValue)` method  

### Step 2 – Refactor QuantityLength
- Remove all internal conversion logic  
- Delegate all conversion operations to `LengthUnit` methods  

### Step 3 – Update All References
- Ensure all imports reference standalone `LengthUnit`  
- Remove any assumptions of `LengthUnit` being nested  

### Step 4 – Maintain Backward Compatibility
- Public API of `QuantityLength` remains unchanged  
- All existing method signatures and behaviors preserved  

### Step 5 – Verify All Test Cases
- Run all UC1–UC7 test cases without modification  
- Confirm no regressions in equality, conversion, or addition  

---
## Test Scenarios
### LengthUnit Enum Constants
- Verify `FEET`, `INCHES`, `YARDS`, `CENTIMETERS` accessible as standalone  

### convertToBaseUnit
- Feet → Feet (no change)  
- Inches → Feet  
- Yards → Feet  
- Centimeters → Feet  

### convertFromBaseUnit
- Feet → Feet (no change)  
- Feet → Inches  
- Feet → Yards  
- Feet → Centimeters  

### Refactored QuantityLength
- Equality using delegated conversion  
- `convertTo()` using unit methods  
- `add()` with and without target unit  

### Invalid Input
- Null unit → exception  
- `Double.NaN` value → exception  

### Backward Compatibility
- All UC1–UC7 test cases pass unchanged  

### Round-Trip Conversion
- `convert(convert(value, A→B), B→A) ≈ value` within epsilon  

---
## Sample Test Cases
- `testLengthUnitEnum_FeetConstant()`  
- `testLengthUnitEnum_InchesConstant()`  
- `testLengthUnitEnum_YardsConstant()`

## Conclusion
UC8 enhances the system by introducing a **clean architectural separation** between unit conversion logic and quantity domain logic.  
By extracting `LengthUnit` as a standalone enum with full conversion responsibility, the system becomes:
- More cohesive — each class has a single, well-defined role  
- More scalable — new measurement categories plug in without refactoring existing code  
- More maintainable — conversion logic changes are isolated to `LengthUnit`  
- Free of circular dependencies across measurement categories  

This marks a foundational step toward building a **complete, enterprise-grade measurement system** supporting multiple unit categories with clean, decoupled architecture.

# Quantity Measurement App – UC9: Weight Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition (Kilogram, Gram, Pound)
## Overview
UC9 extends the Quantity Measurement Application to support **weight measurements** alongside length measurements.  
It introduces a new measurement category — weight — that operates **independently from length**, supporting equality comparison, unit conversion, and addition across kilograms, grams, and pounds.

---
## Objective
To:
- Introduce `WeightUnit` enum as a standalone class with conversion responsibility  
- Implement `QuantityWeight` class mirroring the `QuantityLength` design  
- Support equality, conversion, and addition for weight measurements  
- Enforce category type safety (weight ≠ length)  
- Validate that the UC1–UC8 design pattern scales seamlessly to new measurement categories  

---
## Features
- Equality comparison between weight measurements across all unit combinations  
- Unit conversion between Kilogram, Gram, and Pound  
- Addition with implicit target unit (first operand's unit) and explicit target unit  
- Category type safety — weight and length measurements are non-interoperable  
- Full backward compatibility with UC1–UC8 length functionality  
- Immutable `QuantityWeight` objects (value and unit are final)  

---
## Project Structure
- `WeightUnit` – Standalone enum with conversion factors and conversion methods  
- `QuantityWeight` – Class focused on weight comparison, conversion, and arithmetic  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Demo methods extended for weight operations  

---
## Working Flow
1. Two `QuantityWeight` objects with their respective units are provided  
2. Input validation is performed (non-null unit, finite value)  
3. Both values are converted to the **base unit (kilogram)** using `WeightUnit` conversion methods  
4. Equality comparison, conversion, or addition is performed  
5. Result is converted to the **target unit** (implicit or explicit)  
6. A new immutable `QuantityWeight` object is returned  

---
## Conversion Logic


| Unit       | Conversion Factor (to kg) |
|------------|---------------------------|
| KILOGRAM   | 1.0                       |
| GRAM       | 0.001                     |
| POUND      | 0.453592                  |

---
## Example

**Equality:**  
`Quantity(1.0, KILOGRAM).equals(Quantity(1000.0, GRAM))`  
→ `true`

`Quantity(1.0, KILOGRAM).equals(Quantity(~2.20462, POUND))`  
→ `true` (within epsilon)

`Quantity(500.0, GRAM).equals(Quantity(0.5, KILOGRAM))`  
→ `true`

**Conversion:**  
`Quantity(1.0, KILOGRAM).convertTo(GRAM)`  
→ `Quantity(1000.0, GRAM)`

`Quantity(2.0, POUND).convertTo(KILOGRAM)`  
→ `Quantity(~0.907184, KILOGRAM)`

`Quantity(500.0, GRAM).convertTo(POUND)`  
→ `Quantity(~1.10231, POUND)`

**Addition (Implicit Target Unit):**  
`Quantity(1.0, KILOGRAM).add(Quantity(1000.0, GRAM))`  
→ `Quantity(2.0, KILOGRAM)`

**Addition (Explicit Target Unit):**  
`Quantity(1.0, KILOGRAM).add(Quantity(1000.0, GRAM), GRAM)`  
→ `Quantity(2000.0, GRAM)`

`Quantity(2.0, KILOGRAM).add(Quantity(4.0, POUND), KILOGRAM)`  
→ `Quantity(~3.82, KILOGRAM)`

**Category Incompatibility:**  
`Quantity(1.0, KILOGRAM).equals(Quantity(1.0, FOOT))`  
→ `false`

---
## Concepts Used
### Multiple Measurement Categories
- Weight operates independently from length  
- Each category has its own unit enum and quantity class  
- Categories are type-safe and non-interoperable  

### Scalable Generic Design Pattern
- `WeightUnit` and `QuantityWeight` mirror `LengthUnit` and `QuantityLength`  
- Pattern is replicable for temperature, volume, time, and other categories  

### Category Type Safety
- `equals()` checks `getClass()` to reject cross-category comparisons  
- Compile-time and runtime safety prevent logical errors  

### Base Unit Normalization
- Kilogram is the base unit for weight (mirrors feet for length)  
- Centralized normalization through `WeightUnit` methods  

### Enum-Based Responsibility Assignment
- `WeightUnit` encapsulates conversion logic (following UC8 principles)  
- `QuantityWeight` focuses on comparison and arithmetic only  

### Immutability
- `QuantityWeight` objects are immutable — operations return new instances  
- Thread-safe across concurrent callers  

### Method Overloading
- `add(a, b)` → result in first operand's unit (UC6-equivalent)  
- `add(a, b, targetUnit)` → result in specified unit (UC7-equivalent)  

### Equals and HashCode Contract
- Both `equals()` and `hashCode()` are consistently overridden  
- Enables use in sets, maps, and hash-based collections  

### Floating-Point Precision
- Epsilon-based tolerance accommodates floating-point rounding  
- Consistent rounding (two decimal places) ensures predictability  

---
## Implementation Steps

### Step 1 – Create WeightUnit Standalone Enum
- Define constants: `KILOGRAM`, `GRAM`, `POUND`  
- Assign conversion factors relative to kilogram  
- Implement `getConversionFactor()`, `convertToBaseUnit()`, `convertFromBaseUnit()`  

### Step 2 – Implement QuantityWeight Class
- Mirror `QuantityLength` design with `WeightUnit` enum  
- Validate unit (not null) and value (finite number) in constructor  
- Implement `equals()`, `convertTo()`, overloaded `add()`, and `toString()`  

### Step 3 – Enforce Category Type Safety
- `equals()` returns `false` for cross-category comparisons  
- Document that weight and length are incompatible categories  

### Step 4 – Ensure Conversion Accuracy
- Verify: `1 kg = 1000 g`, `1 lb ≈ 0.453592 kg`, `1 kg ≈ 2.20462 lb`  
- Test round-trip conversions within epsilon (`1e-6`)  

### Step 5 – Verify Test Coverage
- Equality: same unit, cross-unit, incompatible category, null, edge cases  
- Conversion: all unit pairs, zero, negative, round-trip  
- Addition: same unit, cross-unit, explicit target unit, commutativity, edge cases  

---
## Test Scenarios
### Equality Tests
- Kilogram-to-kilogram same value → `true`  
- Kilogram-to-gram equivalent value → `true`  
- Kilogram-to-pound equivalent value → `true` (within epsilon)  
- Gram-to-pound equivalent value → `true`  
- Different values in same unit → `false`  
- Weight vs. length comparison → `false`  
- Null comparison → `false`  
- Same reference → `true`  
- Zero values across units → `true`  
- Negative values across units → `true`  

### Conversion Tests
- Kilogram → Gram, Gram → Kilogram  
- Pound → Kilogram, Kilogram → Pound  
- Gram → Pound, Pound → Gram  
- Same unit conversion (no change)  
- Zero and negative value conversions  
- Round-trip conversion within epsilon  

### Addition Tests
- Same unit addition (kg + kg)  
- Cross-unit addition (kg + g, lb + kg)  
- Explicit target unit (result in any unit)  
- Commutativity with target unit  
- Addition with zero  
- Addition with negative values  
- Addition with large magnitude values  

### Edge Cases
- Null unit → `IllegalArgumentException`  
- `Double.NaN` value → `IllegalArgumentException`  
- Infinite value → `IllegalArgumentException`

## Conclusion
UC9 validates that the **generic design patterns established in UC1–UC8 scale seamlessly** to new measurement categories.  
By introducing weight measurements with no changes to existing length classes, the system demonstrates:
- Clean **category independence** — weight and length coexist without interference  
- True **architectural scalability** — adding a new category requires only a new enum and quantity class  
- Consistent **API design** — weight operations mirror length operations exactly  
- Robust **type safety** — cross-category comparisons are rejected at runtime  

This marks a significant step toward a **complete, enterprise-grade measurement system** supporting multiple unit categories with clean, decoupled, and maintainable architecture.

# Quantity Measurement App – UC10: Generic Quantity Class with Unit Interface for Multi-Category Support
## Overview
UC10 refactors the design from UC1–UC9 by introducing a **single generic `Quantity<U>` class** that works across all measurement categories through a common `IMeasurable` interface.  
This eliminates code duplication across parallel `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight` classes, restores the **Single Responsibility Principle**, and establishes a **linearly scalable architecture** for future measurement categories.

---
## Objective
To:
- Define an `IMeasurable` interface as a contract for all unit enums  
- Refactor `LengthUnit` and `WeightUnit` to implement `IMeasurable`  
- Replace `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight` with a single generic `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>` class  
- Simplify `QuantityMeasurementApp` to use generic demonstration methods  
- Uphold DRY and SRP principles across the entire system  
- Maintain full backward compatibility with UC1–UC9  

---
## Features
- Single `Quantity<U>` class handles all measurement categories  
- `IMeasurable` interface standardizes unit behavior across all enums  
- Compiler-enforced type safety via bounded generics (`<U extends IMeasurable>`)  
- Cross-category comparison prevention at both compile-time and runtime  
- Generic demonstration methods in `QuantityMeasurementApp` — no category-specific duplication  
- New measurement categories require only a new enum implementing `IMeasurable`  
- All UC1–UC9 functionality preserved — no client code changes required  

---
## Project Structure
- `IMeasurable` – Interface defining the unit conversion contract  
- `LengthUnit` – Refactored to implement `IMeasurable`  
- `WeightUnit` – Refactored to implement `IMeasurable`  
- `Quantity<U>` – Single generic class replacing `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight`  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Simplified with generic demonstration methods  

---
## Working Flow
1. `IMeasurable` interface defined with `getConversionFactor()`, `convertToBaseUnit()`, `convertFromBaseUnit()`, `getUnitName()`  
2. `LengthUnit` and `WeightUnit` implement `IMeasurable` — no external API changes  
3. `Quantity<U>` is instantiated with any `IMeasurable` unit  
4. Constructor validates unit (non-null) and value (finite)  
5. Operations (`equals`, `convertTo`, `add`) delegate to unit's `IMeasurable` methods  
6. `equals()` checks `unit.getClass()` to reject cross-category comparisons  
7. A new immutable `Quantity<U>` is returned for all operations  

---
## ⚙️ Conversion Logic

```
// Convert any unit to base unit
baseValue = value * unit.getConversionFactor()

// Convert base unit to target unit
result = baseValue / targetUnit.getConversionFactor()
```

| Category | Base Unit  | Units Supported                        |
|----------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Length   | FEET       | FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS       |
| Weight   | KILOGRAM   | KILOGRAM, GRAM, POUND                  |

---
## Example

**Length (UC1–UC8 preserved):**  
`new Quantity<>(1.0, LengthUnit.FEET).equals(new Quantity<>(12.0, LengthUnit.INCHES))`  
→ `true`

`new Quantity<>(1.0, LengthUnit.FEET).convertTo(LengthUnit.INCHES)`  
→ `Quantity(12.0, INCHES)`

`new Quantity<>(1.0, LengthUnit.FEET).add(new Quantity<>(12.0, LengthUnit.INCHES), LengthUnit.FEET)`  
→ `Quantity(2.0, FEET)`

**Weight (UC9 preserved):**  
`new Quantity<>(1.0, WeightUnit.KILOGRAM).equals(new Quantity<>(1000.0, WeightUnit.GRAM))`  
→ `true`

`new Quantity<>(1.0, WeightUnit.KILOGRAM).convertTo(WeightUnit.GRAM)`  
→ `Quantity(1000.0, GRAM)`

`new Quantity<>(1.0, WeightUnit.KILOGRAM).add(new Quantity<>(1000.0, WeightUnit.GRAM), WeightUnit.KILOGRAM)`  
→ `Quantity(2.0, KILOGRAM)`

**Cross-Category Prevention:**  
`new Quantity<>(1.0, LengthUnit.FEET).equals(new Quantity<>(1.0, WeightUnit.KILOGRAM))`  
→ `false`

`demonstrateEquality(Quantity<LengthUnit>, Quantity<WeightUnit>)`  
→ Compiler error (type mismatch)

---
## Disadvantages of UC9 Addressed

| UC9 Problem | UC10 Solution |
|-------------|---------------|
| Duplicate `QuantityLength` / `QuantityWeight` classes | Single `Quantity<U>` class |
| Duplicate unit enum structures | `IMeasurable` interface eliminates redundancy |
| `QuantityMeasurementApp` SRP violation | Generic methods replace category-specific ones |
| Exponential code growth per new category | Linear growth — new enum only |
| Inconsistency risk across categories | Single source of truth for all operations |
| Limited API flexibility | `Quantity<?>` wildcards enable polymorphic methods |

---
## Concepts Used
### Generic Programming
- Bounded type parameters (`<U extends IMeasurable>`) enforce constraints at compile-time  
- Generics eliminate code duplication while maintaining full type safety  

### Interface-Based Design
- `IMeasurable` defines a contract for all measurement units  
- Enums implementing interfaces encapsulate behavior within constants  
- Enables polymorphic treatment of different unit types  

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- `IMeasurable` — defines unit abstraction contract  
- `Quantity<U>` — handles value operations (equals, add, convert)  
- Unit enums — provide unit-specific constants and conversion factors  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` — orchestration and demonstration only  

### DRY Principle
- Logic implemented once in `Quantity<U>`, reused across all categories  
- Bug fixes automatically benefit all measurement types  

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- System is open for extension (new unit enums) but closed for modification  
- New categories added without changing `Quantity<U>` or `QuantityMeasurementApp`  

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Any `IMeasurable` implementation works interchangeably with `Quantity<U>`  
- No special handling required for different unit types  

### Composition Over Inheritance
- `Quantity<U>` holds a `U` (composition) rather than extending category-specific classes  
- More flexible than inheritance-based designs  

### Cross-Category Type Safety
- `equals()` checks `unit.getClass()` for runtime category matching  
- Compiler enforces category constraints through generics  

### Immutability
- `Quantity<U>` objects are immutable — all operations return new instances  
- Thread-safe across concurrent callers  

### Enum as Behavior Carrier
- Enums implement `IMeasurable`, carrying both data and behavior  
- Immutable and thread-safe by nature  

---
## Implementation Steps

### Step 1 – Define IMeasurable Interface
- Methods: `getConversionFactor()`, `convertToBaseUnit()`, `convertFromBaseUnit()`, `getUnitName()`  
- Minimal, focused contract — no unnecessary methods  

### Step 2 – Refactor LengthUnit
- Add `implements IMeasurable`  
- Implement all interface methods using existing conversion logic  
- No external API changes — fully backward compatible  

### Step 3 – Refactor WeightUnit
- Identical structure to refactored `LengthUnit`  
- Consistent implementation across enums supports polymorphism  

### Step 4 – Create Generic Quantity Class
- Replace `QuantityLength` and `QuantityWeight` with `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>`  
- Implement `equals()`, `convertTo()`, overloaded `add()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`  
- `equals()` includes `unit.getClass()` check for cross-category prevention  

### Step 5 – Simplify QuantityMeasurementApp
- Replace category-specific methods with single generic `demonstrateEquality()`, `demonstrateConversion()`, `demonstrateAddition()`  
- Reduce class to orchestration responsibilities only  

### Step 6 – Update Test Classes
- Rename to `QuantityTest` (replaces `QuantityLengthTest` and `QuantityWeightTest`)  
- Use parameterized tests or separate test classes per category  
- All test logic remains identical — only type parameters change  

### Step 7 – Verify Backward Compatibility
- Run all UC1–UC9 test cases unchanged  
- Confirm behavior is identical to previous implementation  

---
## Test Scenarios
### IMeasurable Interface Tests
- `LengthUnit` correctly implements all interface methods  
- `WeightUnit` correctly implements all interface methods  
- Consistent method behavior across both enums  

### Generic Quantity — Length Operations
- Equality, conversion, and addition via `Quantity<LengthUnit>`  
- Identical behavior to original `QuantityLength`  

### Generic Quantity — Weight Operations
- Equality, conversion, and addition via `Quantity<WeightUnit>`  
- Identical behavior to original `QuantityWeight`  

### Cross-Category Prevention
- `equals()` returns `false` when categories differ  
- Compiler rejects type mismatches at compile-time  

### Constructor Validation
- Null unit → `IllegalArgumentException`  
- `Double.NaN` value → `IllegalArgumentException`  
- Infinite value → `IllegalArgumentException`  

### Simplified QuantityMeasurementApp
- `demonstrateEquality()` handles both length and weight  
- `demonstrateConversion()` handles both length and weight  
- `demonstrateAddition()` handles both length and weight  

### Scalability
- New `VolumeUnit` enum integrates with `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` without any other changes  
- No modifications to `Quantity<U>` or `QuantityMeasurementApp` required  

### Backward Compatibility
- All UC1–UC9 test cases pass without modification

# Quantity Measurement App – UC11: Volume Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition (Litre, Millilitre, Gallon)
## Overview
UC11 extends the Quantity Measurement Application to support **volume measurements** alongside length and weight measurements.  
It introduces a new measurement category — volume — that operates **independently from length and weight** through the generic `Quantity<U>` class and `IMeasurable` interface established in UC10.

UC11 validates that the UC10 architecture **truly scales linearly** — adding a complete new measurement category requires only a single new enum, with **zero changes** to `Quantity<U>`, `IMeasurable`, or `QuantityMeasurementApp`.

---
## Objective
To:
- Create a `VolumeUnit` enum implementing `IMeasurable` with `LITRE` as the base unit  
- Support equality comparison, unit conversion, and addition for volume measurements  
- Enforce category type safety (volume ≠ length ≠ weight)  
- Prove that the UC10 generic architecture scales seamlessly to a third measurement category  
- Maintain full backward compatibility with UC1–UC10  

---
## Features
- Equality comparison between volume measurements across all unit combinations  
- Unit conversion between Litre, Millilitre, and Gallon  
- Addition with implicit target unit (first operand's unit) and explicit target unit  
- Category type safety — volume cannot be compared with length or weight  
- **Zero modifications** to `Quantity<U>`, `IMeasurable`, or `QuantityMeasurementApp`  
- Full backward compatibility with all UC1–UC10 functionality  

---
## Project Structure
- `VolumeUnit` – New standalone enum implementing `IMeasurable` (only new file required)  
- `Quantity<U>` – Unchanged; works with `VolumeUnit` automatically  
- `IMeasurable` – Unchanged; already supports any unit enum  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Unchanged; generic methods handle volume automatically  

---
## Working Flow
1. `VolumeUnit` enum is created implementing `IMeasurable`  
2. Conversion factors defined relative to litre (base unit)  
3. `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` instances created using the existing generic class  
4. Input validation performed (non-null unit, finite value) by existing constructor  
5. Both values converted to **base unit (litre)** using `VolumeUnit` conversion methods  
6. Equality comparison, conversion, or addition performed by existing generic logic  
7. Result converted to **target unit** (implicit or explicit)  
8. New immutable `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` returned  

---
## ⚙️ Conversion Logic

```
// Convert any unit to base unit (litre)
baseValue = value * unit.getConversionFactor()

// Convert base unit (litre) to target unit
result = baseValue / targetUnit.getConversionFactor()
```

| Unit        | Conversion Factor (to litres) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| LITRE       | 1.0                           |
| MILLILITRE  | 0.001                         |
| GALLON      | 3.78541                       |

---
## Example

**Equality:**  
`new Quantity<>(1.0, LITRE).equals(new Quantity<>(1000.0, MILLILITRE))`  
→ `true`

`new Quantity<>(1.0, LITRE).equals(new Quantity<>(~0.264172, GALLON))`  
→ `true` (within epsilon)

`new Quantity<>(3.78541, LITRE).equals(new Quantity<>(1.0, GALLON))`  
→ `true` (within epsilon)

**Conversion:**  
`new Quantity<>(1.0, LITRE).convertTo(MILLILITRE)`  
→ `Quantity(1000.0, MILLILITRE)`

`new Quantity<>(2.0, GALLON).convertTo(LITRE)`  
→ `Quantity(~7.57082, LITRE)`

`new Quantity<>(500.0, MILLILITRE).convertTo(GALLON)`  
→ `Quantity(~0.132086, GALLON)`

**Addition (Implicit Target Unit):**  
`new Quantity<>(1.0, LITRE).add(new Quantity<>(1000.0, MILLILITRE))`  
→ `Quantity(2.0, LITRE)`

`new Quantity<>(2.0, GALLON).add(new Quantity<>(3.78541, LITRE))`  
→ `Quantity(3.0, GALLON)`

**Addition (Explicit Target Unit):**  
`new Quantity<>(1.0, LITRE).add(new Quantity<>(1000.0, MILLILITRE), MILLILITRE)`  
→ `Quantity(2000.0, MILLILITRE)`

`new Quantity<>(500.0, MILLILITRE).add(new Quantity<>(1.0, LITRE), GALLON)`  
→ `Quantity(~0.396258, GALLON)`

**Category Incompatibility:**  
`new Quantity<>(1.0, LITRE).equals(new Quantity<>(1.0, FOOT))`  
→ `false`

`new Quantity<>(1.0, LITRE).equals(new Quantity<>(1.0, KILOGRAM))`  
→ `false`

---
## Concepts Used
### Scalability of Generic Design
- Adding a third category requires **only a new enum** implementing `IMeasurable`  
- Zero changes to `Quantity<U>`, demonstration methods, or test infrastructure  
- Validates that UC10 architecture achieves true linear scalability  

### Pattern Replication Across Categories
- `VolumeUnit` mirrors the structure of `LengthUnit` and `WeightUnit`  
- Identical enum patterns reduce cognitive load for new developers  

### Base Unit Selection
- Litre is chosen as the base unit for volume (mirrors feet for length, kilogram for weight)  
- Base unit selection impacts conversion factor precision and formula simplicity  

### IMeasurable Interface Power
- Single interface enables polymorphic treatment of all measurement units  
- Volume integrates transparently — no branching or special-case code  

### Generic Type Constraints
- Bounded type parameter `<U extends IMeasurable>` ensures only valid units are used  
- Compiler prevents mixing `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` with `Quantity<LengthUnit>` or `Quantity<WeightUnit>`  

### DRY Principle at Scale
- Three categories now share one implementation — comparison, conversion, and addition logic written once  
- Confirms DRY principle holds across an expanding number of categories  

### Immutability Across All Categories
- `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` objects are immutable — all operations return new instances  
- Consistent with length and weight behavior  

### Floating-Point Precision
- Volume conversions require accuracy to multiple decimal places (e.g., 3.78541 for gallons)  
- Epsilon-based tolerance handles floating-point rounding consistently  

### Polymorphic Unit Behavior
- `LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`, and `VolumeUnit` treated uniformly through `IMeasurable`  
- Generic demonstration methods in `QuantityMeasurementApp` work automatically  

---
## Implementation Steps

### Step 1 – Create VolumeUnit Enum
- Define constants: `LITRE`, `MILLILITRE`, `GALLON`  
- Assign conversion factors relative to litre  
- Implement `getConversionFactor()`, `convertToBaseUnit()`, `convertFromBaseUnit()`, `getUnitName()`  

### Step 2 – Verify Conversion Factor Accuracy
- `LITRE`: 1.0 (base unit)  
- `MILLILITRE`: 0.001 (1 mL = 0.001 L)  
- `GALLON`: 3.78541 (1 US gallon ≈ 3.78541 L)  

### Step 3 – Create Quantity Instances
- Use existing `Quantity<U>` class: `new Quantity<>(1.0, VolumeUnit.LITRE)`  
- No new class creation required  

### Step 4 – Test Equality Comparisons
- Verify `equals()` works for same-unit, cross-unit, and cross-category comparisons  

### Step 5 – Test Unit Conversions
- Verify `convertTo()` works for all volume unit pairs  

### Step 6 – Test Addition Operations
- Verify `add()` works with implicit and explicit target unit specification  

### Step 7 – Test Cross-Category Prevention
- Confirm volume cannot be compared with length or weight measurements  

### Step 8 – Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Cover all equality, conversion, addition, edge case, and precision scenarios  

### Step 9 – Integration Testing
- Verify existing generic `demonstrateEquality()`, `demonstrateConversion()`, `demonstrateAddition()` work with volume without modification  

### Step 10 – Backward Compatibility Validation
- Run all UC1–UC10 test cases unchanged to confirm no regressions

## Conclusion
UC11 delivers the ultimate proof of the generic architecture established in UC10 — a **complete new measurement category integrated with a single enum file** and zero changes to the existing codebase.  
By introducing volume measurements through only `VolumeUnit`, the system confirms:
- **True linear scalability** — complexity grows by one file per new category, not exponentially  
- **Architectural maturity** — the `IMeasurable` + `Quantity<U>` pattern handles any measurement type  
- **Developer experience** — new categories follow a clear, repeatable pattern with no guesswork  
- **Zero regression risk** — existing length and weight functionality is completely unaffected  

This marks the point where the Quantity Measurement Application becomes a **production-ready, infinitely extensible measurement framework** capable of supporting any measurement category — temperature, time, pressure, speed, and beyond — without ever touching the core classes again.

# Quantity Measurement App – UC12: Subtraction and Division Operations on Quantity Measurements
## Overview
UC12 extends the Quantity Measurement Application by introducing two new arithmetic operations — **subtraction** and **division** — to the generic `Quantity<U>` class.  
Building on equality comparison, unit conversion, and addition from UC1–UC11, this use case enables comprehensive arithmetic manipulation of measurements across all supported categories (length, weight, volume).

Subtraction finds the **difference** between two quantities of the same category. Division computes the **ratio** between two quantities, producing a dimensionless scalar result that represents how many times one measurement is larger than another.

---
## Objective
To:
- Add `subtract()` methods (implicit and explicit target unit) to `Quantity<U>`  
- Add a `divide()` method returning a dimensionless `double` scalar  
- Maintain all design patterns from UC1–UC11 (immutability, validation, cross-category safety)  
- Add corresponding demonstration methods to `QuantityMeasurementApp`  
- Preserve full backward compatibility with all UC1–UC11 functionality  

---
## Features
- Subtraction of two quantities with result in implicit or explicit target unit  
- Division of two quantities returning a dimensionless scalar ratio  
- Cross-unit arithmetic within the same measurement category  
- Division-by-zero prevention via `ArithmeticException`  
- Cross-category arithmetic prevention (`IllegalArgumentException`)  
- Immutability — original quantities unchanged by all operations  
- Works across all categories: length, weight, and volume  

---
## Project Structure
- `Quantity<U>` – Extended with `subtract()` and `divide()` methods  
- `IMeasurable` – Unchanged; conversion methods reused by new operations  
- `LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit` – Unchanged  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Extended with subtraction and division demonstration methods  

---
## Working Flow

### Subtraction
1. Client calls `subtract(other)` or `subtract(other, targetUnit)`  
2. Validate: `other` is non-null, same category, finite value  
3. Convert both operands to base unit  
4. Compute: `baseResult = this.baseValue - other.baseValue`  
5. Convert result to target unit (implicit = first operand's unit, or explicit)  
6. Round to two decimal places  
7. Return new immutable `Quantity<U>`  

### Division
1. Client calls `divide(other)`  
2. Validate: `other` is non-null, same category, finite value, non-zero  
3. Convert both operands to base unit  
4. Compute: `result = this.baseValue / other.baseValue`  
5. Return dimensionless `double` scalar (no unit)

## ⚙️ Arithmetic Logic

```
// Subtraction
baseResult = (this.value * this.unit.getConversionFactor())
           - (other.value * other.unit.getConversionFactor())
finalResult = baseResult / targetUnit.getConversionFactor()

// Division (dimensionless)
result = (this.value * this.unit.getConversionFactor())
       / (other.value * other.unit.getConversionFactor())
```

| Operation   | Returns          | Commutative | Target Unit Support |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `add()`     | `Quantity<U>`    | Yes         | Implicit + Explicit |
| `subtract()`| `Quantity<U>`    | No          | Implicit + Explicit |
| `divide()`  | `double` scalar  | No          | N/A (dimensionless) |

## Example

**Subtraction (Implicit Target Unit):**  
`new Quantity<>(10.0, FEET).subtract(new Quantity<>(6.0, INCHES))`  
→ `Quantity(9.5, FEET)`

`new Quantity<>(10.0, KILOGRAM).subtract(new Quantity<>(5000.0, GRAM))`  
→ `Quantity(5.0, KILOGRAM)`

`new Quantity<>(5.0, LITRE).subtract(new Quantity<>(500.0, MILLILITRE))`  
→ `Quantity(4.5, LITRE)`

**Subtraction (Explicit Target Unit):**  
`new Quantity<>(10.0, FEET).subtract(new Quantity<>(6.0, INCHES), INCHES)`  
→ `Quantity(114.0, INCHES)`

`new Quantity<>(5.0, LITRE).subtract(new Quantity<>(2.0, LITRE), MILLILITRE)`  
→ `Quantity(3000.0, MILLILITRE)`

**Subtraction (Negative Result):**  
`new Quantity<>(5.0, FEET).subtract(new Quantity<>(10.0, FEET))`  
→ `Quantity(-5.0, FEET)`

**Subtraction (Zero Result):**  
`new Quantity<>(10.0, FEET).subtract(new Quantity<>(120.0, INCHES))`  
→ `Quantity(0.0, FEET)`

**Division:**  
`new Quantity<>(10.0, FEET).divide(new Quantity<>(2.0, FEET))`  
→ `5.0`

`new Quantity<>(24.0, INCHES).divide(new Quantity<>(2.0, FEET))`  
→ `1.0`

`new Quantity<>(5.0, LITRE).divide(new Quantity<>(10.
