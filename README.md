1. The main method calls:
   - Feet equality method
   - Inches equality method  
2. Values are validated to ensure they are numeric  
3. Objects of Feet/Inches are created  
4. `equals()` method is invoked  
5. Result (`true` / `false`) is returned  

---

## Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## Limitation (Current Design)
The current implementation uses **separate Feet and Inches classes**, which leads to code duplication:

- Same constructor logic  
- Same `equals()` implementation  
- Same structure  

This violates the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle.

---

## Suggested Improvement
To improve the design:
- Use a **generic `Quantity` class**
- Add a **unit type parameter (Feet/Inches)**
- Centralize equality logic  

This will:
- Reduce duplication  
- Improve maintainability  
- Make the system scalable for future units  

---

## Conclusion
UC2 enhances the application by supporting multiple measurement types while maintaining robust equality checks.  
It also highlights the need for better design patterns to avoid redundancy in future use cases.

- Maintain full backward compatibility with UC1–UC7  

---
## Features
- `LengthUnit` as a standalone enum with `convertToBaseUnit()` and `convertFromBaseUnit()` methods  
- `QuantityLength` simplified to focus solely on comparison and arithmetic  
- All unit combinations supported: Feet, Inches, Yards, Centimeters  
- Backward compatible — no client code changes required  
- Scalable pattern for future measurement categories (Weight, Volume, Temperature)  

---
## Project Structure
- `LengthUnit` – Standalone enum with conversion factors and conversion methods  
- `QuantityLength` – Simplified class focused on comparison and arithmetic  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Demo methods using refactored design  

---
## Working Flow
1. `LengthUnit` is extracted to a top-level standalone enum  
2. Conversion factors defined as constants in `LengthUnit`  
3. `convertToBaseUnit(value)` converts a value in this unit → feet  
4. `convertFromBaseUnit(baseValue)` converts feet → this unit  
5. `QuantityLength` delegates all conversion calls to `LengthUnit` methods  
6. All existing operations (equality, conversion, addition) work identically  

---
## Conversion Logic

| Unit         | Conversion Factor (to feet) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| FEET         | 1.0                         |
| INCHES       | 1/12 ≈ 0.0833               |
| YARDS        | 3.0                         |
| CENTIMETERS  | 1/30.48 ≈ 0.0328            |

---

## Concepts Used
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- `LengthUnit` handles conversions  
- `QuantityLength` handles comparison and arithmetic  

### Separation of Concerns
- Unit-specific logic isolated in `LengthUnit`  
- Domain logic isolated in `QuantityLength`

### Encapsulation
- Conversion formulas hidden within `LengthUnit` — external classes use public API only  

### Scalability Pattern
- Template established for `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit`, `TemperatureUnit`  

### Java Enum Capabilities
- Enums encapsulate data (conversion factors) and behavior (conversion methods)  
- Inherently immutable and thread-safe  

### Refactoring Best Practices
- Functionality preserved while improving internal structure  
- Backward compatibility maintained throughout  

---


## Conclusion
UC8 enhances the system by introducing a **clean architectural separation** between unit conversion logic and quantity domain logic.  
By extracting `LengthUnit` as a standalone enum with full conversion responsibility, the system becomes:
- More cohesive — each class has a single, well-defined role  
- More scalable — new measurement categories plug in without refactoring existing code  
- More maintainable — conversion logic changes are isolated to `LengthUnit`

| POUND      | 0.453592                  |

---

## Concepts Used

### Multiple Measurement Categories
- Weight operates independently from length  
- Each category has its own unit enum and quantity class  
- Categories are type-safe and non-interoperable  

### Scalable Generic Design Pattern
- `WeightUnit` and `QuantityWeight` mirror `LengthUnit` and `QuantityLength`  
- Pattern is replicable for temperature, volume, time, and other categories  

### Category Type Safety
- `equals()` checks `getClass()` to reject cross-category comparisons  
- Compile-time and runtime safety prevent logical errors  

### Base Unit Normalization
- Kilogram is the base unit for weight (mirrors feet for length)  
- Centralized normalization through `WeightUnit` methods  

### Enum-Based Responsibility Assignment
- `WeightUnit` encapsulates conversion logic (following UC8 principles)  
- `QuantityWeight` focuses on comparison and arithmetic only  

### Immutability
- `QuantityWeight` objects are immutable — operations return new instances  
- Thread-safe across concurrent callers  

### Method Overloading
- `add(a, b)` → result in first operand's unit (UC6-equivalent)  
- `add(a, b, targetUnit)` → result in specified unit (UC7-equivalent)  

### Equals and HashCode Contract
- Both `equals()` and `hashCode()` are consistently overridden  
- Enables use in sets, maps, and hash-based collections  

### Floating-Point Precision
- Epsilon-based tolerance accommodates floating-point rounding  
- Consistent rounding (two decimal places) ensures predictability  

---


## Conclusion

UC9 validates that the **generic design patterns established in UC1–UC8 scale seamlessly** to new measurement categories.  
By introducing weight measurements with no changes to existing length classes, the system demonstrates:
- Clean **category independence** — weight and length coexist without interference  
- True **architectural scalability** — adding a new category requires only a new enum and quantity class  
- Consistent **API design** — weight operations mirror length operations exactly  
- Robust **type safety** — cross-category comparisons are rejected at runtime  

This marks a significant step toward a **complete, enterprise-grade measurement system** supporting multiple unit categories with clean, decoupled, and maintainable architecture.

## ⚙️ Conversion Logic


| Category | Base Unit  | Units Supported                        |
|----------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Length   | FEET       | FEET, INCHES, YARDS, CENTIMETERS       |
| Weight   | KILOGRAM   | KILOGRAM, GRAM, POUND                  |

---

## Concepts Used
### Generic Programming
- Bounded type parameters (`<U extends IMeasurable>`) enforce constraints at compile-time  
- Generics eliminate code duplication while maintaining full type safety  

### Interface-Based Design
- `IMeasurable` defines a contract for all measurement units  
- Enums implementing interfaces encapsulate behavior within constants  
- Enables polymorphic treatment of different unit types  

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- `IMeasurable` — defines unit abstraction contract  
- `Quantity<U>` — handles value operations (equals, add, convert)  
- Unit enums — provide unit-specific constants and conversion factors  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` — orchestration and demonstration only  

### DRY Principle
- Logic implemented once in `Quantity<U>`, reused across all categories  
- Bug fixes automatically benefit all measurement types  

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- System is open for extension (new unit enums) but closed for modification  
- New categories added without changing `Quantity<U>` or `QuantityMeasurementApp`  

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Any `IMeasurable` implementation works interchangeably with `Quantity<U>`  
- No special handling required for different unit types  

### Composition Over Inheritance
- `Quantity<U>` holds a `U` (composition) rather than extending category-specific classes  
- More flexible than inheritance-based designs  

### Cross-Category Type Safety
- `equals()` checks `unit.getClass()` for runtime category matching  
- Compiler enforces category constraints through generics  

### Immutability
- `Quantity<U>` objects are immutable — all operations return new instances  
- Thread-safe across concurrent callers  

### Enum as Behavior Carrier
- Enums implement `IMeasurable`, carrying both data and behavior  
- Immutable and thread-safe by nature  

---


## Conclusion
UC10 completes the architectural evolution of the Quantity Measurement Application by replacing category-specific duplication with a **single, type-safe generic design**.  
By introducing the `IMeasurable` interface and the `Quantity<U>` class, the system achieves:
- **Zero duplication** — one class handles all measurement categories  
- **Linear scalability** — adding a new category requires only a new enum  
- **Compile-time and runtime safety** — generics and class checks prevent invalid comparisons  
- **Simplified maintenance** — bug fixes and improvements apply to all categories at once  
- **Full backward compatibility** — all UC1–UC9 behavior is preserved identically  

This marks the culmination of a **complete, enterprise-grade measurement system** — extensible, maintainable, type-safe, and built on proven software design principles.

# Quantity Measurement App – UC11: Volume Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition (Litre, Millilitre, Gallon)
## Overview
UC11 extends the Quantity Measurement Application to support **volume measurements** alongside length and weight measurements.  
It introduces a new measurement category — volume — that operates **independently from length and weight** through the generic `Quantity<U>` class and `IMeasurable` interface established in UC10.

UC11 validates that the UC10 architecture **truly scales linearly** — adding a complete new measurement category requires only a single new enum, with **zero changes** to `Quantity<U>`, `IMeasurable`, or `QuantityMeasurementApp`.

---
## Objective
To:
- Create a `VolumeUnit` enum implementing `IMeasurable` with `LITRE` as the base unit  
- Support equality comparison, unit conversion, and addition for volume measurements  
- Enforce category type safety (volume ≠ length ≠ weight)  
- Prove that the UC10 generic architecture scales seamlessly to a third measurement category  
- Maintain full backward compatibility with UC1–UC10  

---
## Features
- Equality comparison between volume measurements across all unit combinations  
- Unit conversion between Litre, Millilitre, and Gallon  
- Addition with implicit target unit (first operand's unit) and explicit target unit  
- Category type safety — volume cannot be compared with length or weight  
- **Zero modifications** to `Quantity<U>`, `IMeasurable`, or `QuantityMeasurementApp`  
- Full backward compatibility with all UC1–UC10 functionality  

---
## Project Structure
- `VolumeUnit` – New standalone enum implementing `IMeasurable` (only new file required)  
- `Quantity<U>` – Unchanged; works with `VolumeUnit` automatically  
- `IMeasurable` – Unchanged; already supports any unit enum  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Unchanged; generic methods handle volume automatically  

---
## Working Flow
1. `VolumeUnit` enum is created implementing `IMeasurable`  
2. Conversion factors defined relative to litre (base unit)  
3. `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` instances created using the existing generic class  
4. Input validation performed (non-null unit, finite value) by existing constructor  
5. Both values converted to **base unit (litre)** using `VolumeUnit` conversion methods  
6. Equality comparison, conversion, or addition performed by existing generic logic  
7. Result converted to **target unit** (implicit or explicit)  
8. New immutable `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` returned  

---
## ⚙️ Conversion Logic

| Unit        | Conversion Factor (to litres) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| LITRE       | 1.0                           |
| MILLILITRE  | 0.001                         |
| GALLON      | 3.78541                       |

---

## Concepts Used
### Scalability of Generic Design
- Adding a third category requires **only a new enum** implementing `IMeasurable`  
- Zero changes to `Quantity<U>`, demonstration methods, or test infrastructure  
- Validates that UC10 architecture achieves true linear scalability  

### Pattern Replication Across Categories
- `VolumeUnit` mirrors the structure of `LengthUnit` and `WeightUnit`  
- Identical enum patterns reduce cognitive load for new developers  

### Base Unit Selection
- Litre is chosen as the base unit for volume (mirrors feet for length, kilogram for weight)  
- Base unit selection impacts conversion factor precision and formula simplicity  

### IMeasurable Interface Power
- Single interface enables polymorphic treatment of all measurement units  
- Volume integrates transparently — no branching or special-case code  

### Generic Type Constraints
- Bounded type parameter `<U extends IMeasurable>` ensures only valid units are used  
- Compiler prevents mixing `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` with `Quantity<LengthUnit>` or `Quantity<WeightUnit>`  

### DRY Principle at Scale
- Three categories now share one implementation — comparison, conversion, and addition logic written once  
- Confirms DRY principle holds across an expanding number of categories  

### Immutability Across All Categories
- `Quantity<VolumeUnit>` objects are immutable — all operations return new instances  
- Consistent with length and weight behavior  

### Floating-Point Precision
- Volume conversions require accuracy to multiple decimal places (e.g., 3.78541 for gallons)  
- Epsilon-based tolerance handles floating-point rounding consistently  

### Polymorphic Unit Behavior
- `LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`, and `VolumeUnit` treated uniformly through `IMeasurable`  
- Generic demonstration methods in `QuantityMeasurementApp` work automatically  

---


## Conclusion
UC11 delivers the ultimate proof of the generic architecture established in UC10 — a **complete new measurement category integrated with a single enum file** and zero changes to the existing codebase.  
By introducing volume measurements through only `VolumeUnit`, the system confirms:
- **True linear scalability** — complexity grows by one file per new category, not exponentially  
- **Architectural maturity** — the `IMeasurable` + `Quantity<U>` pattern handles any measurement type  
- **Developer experience** — new categories follow a clear, repeatable pattern with no guesswork  
- **Zero regression risk** — existing length and weight functionality is completely unaffected  

This marks the point where the Quantity Measurement Application becomes a **production-ready, infinitely extensible measurement framework** capable of supporting any measurement category — temperature, time, pressure, speed, and beyond — without ever touching the core classes again.

# Quantity Measurement App – UC12: Subtraction and Division Operations on Quantity Measurements
## Overview
UC12 extends the Quantity Measurement Application by introducing two new arithmetic operations — **subtraction** and **division** — to the generic `Quantity<U>` class.  
Building on equality comparison, unit conversion, and addition from UC1–UC11, this use case enables comprehensive arithmetic manipulation of measurements across all supported categories (length, weight, volume).

Subtraction finds the **difference** between two quantities of the same category. Division computes the **ratio** between two quantities, producing a dimensionless scalar result that represents how many times one measurement is larger than another.

---
## Objective
To:
- Add `subtract()` methods (implicit and explicit target unit) to `Quantity<U>`  
- Add a `divide()` method returning a dimensionless `double` scalar  
- Maintain all design patterns from UC1–UC11 (immutability, validation, cross-category safety)  
- Add corresponding demonstration methods to `QuantityMeasurementApp`  
- Preserve full backward compatibility with all UC1–UC11 functionality  

---
## Features
- Subtraction of two quantities with result in implicit or explicit target unit  
- Division of two quantities returning a dimensionless scalar ratio  
- Cross-unit arithmetic within the same measurement category  
- Division-by-zero prevention via `ArithmeticException`  
- Cross-category arithmetic prevention (`IllegalArgumentException`)  
- Immutability — original quantities unchanged by all operations  
- Works across all categories: length, weight, and volume  

---
## Project Structure
- `Quantity<U>` – Extended with `subtract()` and `divide()` methods  
- `IMeasurable` – Unchanged; conversion methods reused by new operations  
- `LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit` – Unchanged  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Extended with subtraction and division demonstration methods  

---
## Working Flow

### Subtraction
1. Client calls `subtract(other)` or `subtract(other, targetUnit)`  
2. Validate: `other` is non-null, same category, finite value  
3. Convert both operands to base unit  
4. Compute: `baseResult = this.baseValue - other.baseValue`  
5. Convert result to target unit (implicit = first operand's unit, or explicit)  
6. Round to two decimal places  
7. Return new immutable `Quantity<U>`  

### Division
1. Client calls `divide(other)`  
2. Validate: `other` is non-null, same category, finite value, non-zero  
3. Convert both operands to base unit  
4. Compute: `result = this.baseValue / other.baseValue`  
5. Return dimensionless `double` scalar (no unit)  

---
## ⚙️ Arithmetic Logic

| Operation   | Returns          | Commutative | Target Unit Support |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `add()`     | `Quantity<U>`    | Yes         | Implicit + Explicit |
| `subtract()`| `Quantity<U>`    | No          | Implicit + Explicit |
| `divide()`  | `double` scalar  | No          | N/A (dimensionless) |

---

## Concepts Used
### Comprehensive Arithmetic Operations
- Quantity system evolves from comparison/conversion to full arithmetic support  
- Multiple operations share common validation and conversion patterns  
- Design accommodates operation diversity without restructuring  

### Non-Commutative Operations
- Subtraction and division are order-dependent — swapping operands changes the result  
- `A.subtract(B) ≠ B.subtract(A)` and `A.divide(B) ≠ B.divide(A)`  
- Testing must verify non-commutativity, unlike commutative addition  

### Division by Zero Handling
- Fail-fast principle: throw `ArithmeticException` rather than return `Infinity` or `NaN`  
- Validation prevents silent logic errors in downstream code  

### Immutability in Arithmetic
- All operations return new instances; original quantities remain unchanged  
- Thread-safe and supports functional composition  
- Consistent with all previous UC operations  

### Target Unit Specification Pattern
- Consistent overloading: implicit (first operand's unit) and explicit target unit  
- Applies to subtraction just as it does to addition  
- Division is dimensionless — no target unit concept applies  

### Cross-Category Type Safety
- `unit.getClass()` check prevents subtraction and division across categories  
- Compile-time and runtime safety layers consistent with UC10+  

### Private Helper Methods for Code Reuse
- Shared conversion and validation logic reduces duplication across operations  
- Adding future operations (modulo, power) follows the same helper structure  

### Validation Consistency
- All operations: null check, category check, finiteness check, zero check (division only)  
- Centralized validation patterns prevent missed edge cases  

### Precision Handling
- Subtraction rounds to two decimal places (consistent with `add()`)  
- Division returns raw `double` — no arbitrary rounding for dimensionless scalars  

---

## Conclusion
UC12 completes the arithmetic foundation of the Quantity Measurement Application by adding **subtraction and division** alongside the existing addition operation.  
Both operations seamlessly integrate into the generic `Quantity<U>` design — following the same validation, conversion, immutability, and type-safety patterns established across UC1–UC11.

The system now supports:
- **Full arithmetic** — add, subtract, divide across any supported measurement category  
- **Non-commutative awareness** — design and tests account for order-dependent operations  
- **Robust error handling** — null safety, cross-category prevention, and division-by-zero protection  
- **Consistent API design** — implicit and explicit target unit overloading mirrors the `add()` pattern  

With UC12, the Quantity Measurement Application is a **fully featured, production-grade measurement framework** — extensible, type-safe, arithmetically complete, and built on proven software engineering principles.

# Quantity Measurement App – UC13: Centralized Arithmetic Logic to Enforce DRY in Quantity Operations
## Overview
UC13 refactors the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, division) implemented in UC12 to **eliminate code duplication** and enforce the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle**.  
Instead of repeating unit conversion, base-unit normalization, and validation logic across each arithmetic method, a centralized private helper extracts all common logic into a single reusable implementation.

The public API remains completely unchanged — all UC12 behaviors are preserved while the internal structure is optimized for clarity, consistency, and scalability.

---
## Objective
To:
- Create a private `ArithmeticOperation` enum to dispatch operations cleanly  
- Extract a centralized `validateArithmeticOperands()` helper for shared validation  
- Extract a centralized `performBaseArithmetic()` helper for shared conversion and computation  
- Refactor `add()`, `subtract()`, and `divide()` to delegate to these helpers  
- Eliminate all duplicated validation, conversion, and error-handling code  
- Maintain full backward compatibility with all UC12 test cases  

---
## Objective
To:
- Create a private `ArithmeticOperation` enum to dispatch operations cleanly  
- Extract a centralized `validateArithmeticOperands()` helper for shared validation  
- Extract a centralized `performBaseArithmetic()` helper for shared conversion and computation  
- Refactor `add()`, `subtract()`, and `divide()` to delegate to these helpers  
- Eliminate all duplicated validation, conversion, and error-handling code  
- Maintain full backward compatibility with all UC12 test cases  

---
## Features
- `ArithmeticOperation` enum with `ADD`, `SUBTRACT`, `DIVIDE` constants (abstract method or lambda approach)  
- `validateArithmeticOperands()` — single source of truth for null, category, and finiteness checks  
- `performBaseArithmetic()` — single source of truth for base-unit conversion and computation  
- All public method signatures unchanged — zero impact on callers  
- Consistent error messages and exception types across all operations  
- Scalable pattern: new operations (multiply, modulo) require only a new enum constant  

---
## Project Structure
- `Quantity<U>` – Refactored internally; public API unchanged  
  - `ArithmeticOperation` (private enum) – dispatches `ADD`, `SUBTRACT`, `DIVIDE`  
  - `validateArithmeticOperands()` (private) – centralized validation  
  - `performBaseArithmetic()` (private) – centralized conversion and computation  
- `IMeasurable`, `LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit` – Unchanged  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Unchanged; no public API changes  

---
## Working Flow

### Before UC13 (UC12 Pattern — Duplicated)
```
add()       → null check → category check → finite check → convert → compute → convert back
subtract()  → null check → category check → finite check → convert → compute → convert back
divide()    → null check → category check → finite check → convert → compute
```

### After UC13 (Centralized Pattern)
```
add()       → validateArithmeticOperands() → performBaseArithmetic(ADD)    → convert result
subtract()  → validateArithmeticOperands() → performBaseArithmetic(SUBTRACT) → convert result
divide()    → validateArithmeticOperands() → performBaseArithmetic(DIVIDE) → return scalar
```

### Internal Flow Example
```
q1.subtract(q2, FEET)
  ↓
validateArithmeticOperands(q2, FEET, true)
  ↓
performBaseArithmetic(q2, SUBTRACT)
  ↓
SUBTRACT.compute(q1.baseValue, q2.baseValue)
  ↓
Convert result to FEET
  ↓
Return new Quantity<>(..., FEET)
```
---

## Conclusion
UC13 applies the same architectural discipline to **internal implementation** that UC10 applied to the class hierarchy — eliminating duplication and establishing a single source of truth.  
By introducing the `ArithmeticOperation` enum and two private helper methods, the system achieves:
- **Zero duplication** — validation and conversion logic written once, shared by all operations  
- **Consistent behavior** — all operations fail identically for invalid inputs  
- **Effortless extensibility** — adding multiplication or modulo requires one enum constant  
- **Improved readability** — public methods are short and expressive; boilerplate is abstracted away  
- **Full backward compatibility** — all UC12 tests pass without a single modification  

UC13 demonstrates that **great architecture is not just about external design** — internal code quality matters equally, and the DRY principle is as important inside a class as it is across the system.

# Quantity Measurement App – UC14: Temperature Measurement with Selective Arithmetic Support and IMeasurable Refactoring
## Overview
UC14 extends the Quantity Measurement Application to support **temperature measurements** alongside length, weight, and volume — while simultaneously revealing and resolving a fundamental limitation in the current `IMeasurable` interface design.

Unlike linear measurement categories (length, weight, volume), temperature conversions are **non-linear** and arithmetic on absolute temperature values is **physically meaningless** (100°C + 50°C ≠ 150°C in any practical sense). This means temperature can only support equality comparison and unit conversion — not addition, subtraction, or division.

To accommodate this, UC14 refactors `IMeasurable` to introduce **optional operation support via default methods** and a `SupportsArithmetic` functional interface, allowing temperature to coexist cleanly with other categories while the existing system remains completely unchanged.

---
## Objective
To:
- Refactor `IMeasurable` to support optional arithmetic through default methods and a `SupportsArithmetic` functional interface  
- Create a `TemperatureUnit` enum implementing `IMeasurable` with non-linear conversion logic  
- Enhance `Quantity<U>` to check operation support before executing arithmetic  
- Ensure `TemperatureUnit` throws `UnsupportedOperationException` for unsupported operations  
- Maintain full backward compatibility with all UC1–UC13 functionality  

---
## Features
- Temperature equality comparison across Celsius and Fahrenheit  
- Non-linear temperature unit conversion (°C ↔ °F) using lambda expressions  
- `UnsupportedOperationException` thrown for add, subtract, and divide on temperature  
- `SupportsArithmetic` functional interface flags whether a unit supports arithmetic  
- `validateOperationSupport()` default method overridden in `TemperatureUnit`  
- All existing categories (length, weight, volume) inherit default `true` — zero changes required  
- Cross-category type safety maintained (temperature ≠ length ≠ weight ≠ volume)  

---
## Project Structure
- `IMeasurable` – Refactored with `SupportsArithmetic` functional interface and default methods  
- `TemperatureUnit` – New enum implementing `IMeasurable` with lambda-based non-linear conversions  
- `Quantity<U>` – Enhanced to call `validateOperationSupport()` before arithmetic  
- `LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit` – Unchanged; inherit default arithmetic support  
- `QuantityMeasurementApp` – Main method extended with temperature demonstrations  

---
## Working Flow

### Equality
1. Two `Quantity<TemperatureUnit>` objects provided  
2. Both values converted to **Celsius (base unit)** using non-linear formulas  
3. Compared using `Double.compare()` within epsilon tolerance  
4. Returns `true` if equivalent, `false` otherwise  

### Conversion
1. `convertTo(targetUnit)` called on a `Quantity<TemperatureUnit>`  
2. Special handling: if `TemperatureUnit`, invoke non-linear conversion formula directly  
3. New immutable `Quantity<TemperatureUnit>` returned  

### Arithmetic (Unsupported)
1. `add()`, `subtract()`, or `divide()` called on `Quantity<TemperatureUnit>`  
2. `this.unit.validateOperationSupport(operation.name())` called first  
3. `TemperatureUnit` overrides this method to throw `UnsupportedOperationException`  
4. Clear error message returned explaining why the operation is invalid  

---

## ⚙️ Temperature Conversion Formulas

```
Celsius → Fahrenheit:   °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
Fahrenheit → Celsius:   °C = (°F − 32) × 5/9
```

| Unit        | Base Unit | Conversion Formula (to Celsius)     |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| CELSIUS     | Celsius   | Identity — no conversion needed     |
| FAHRENHEIT  | Celsius   | `(°F − 32) × 5/9`                   |

---
## Disadvantages of UC13 Addressed

| UC13 Limitation | UC14 Solution |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `IMeasurable` assumes all categories support arithmetic | `SupportsArithmetic` functional interface flags support per unit |
| `Quantity` has no mechanism to block unsupported operations | `validateOperationSupport()` checked before any arithmetic |
| Interface forces temperature to implement dummy arithmetic | Default no-op with override in `TemperatureUnit` |
| No compile-time or early runtime warning for invalid ops | `UnsupportedOperationException` thrown with clear message |
| ISP violated — single interface mixes conversion and arithmetic | Default methods segregate optional operations cleanly |

---
## Concepts Used
### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Refactored `IMeasurable` separates mandatory conversion from optional arithmetic  
- Categories implement only what they genuinely support  
- Forcing temperature to implement dummy arithmetic violates ISP  

### Functional Interface
- `SupportsArithmetic` has exactly one abstract method: `boolean isSupported()`  
- Used with lambda `() -> false` in `TemperatureUnit` to flag no arithmetic support  
- Enables concise, expressive capability declaration  

### Lambda Expressions
- Temperature conversion formulas expressed as `Function<Double, Double>` lambdas  
- Each `TemperatureUnit` constant carries its own conversion lambda  
- `CELSIUS_TO_CELSIUS = (celsius) -> celsius` — identity function  
- `FAHRENHEIT_TO_CELSIUS = (f) -> (f - 32) * 5.0 / 9.0` — formula-based  

### Default Methods in Interfaces
- Provide default implementations that existing units inherit without code changes  
- `TemperatureUnit` overrides `validateOperationSupport()` to block arithmetic  
- Enables non-breaking interface evolution  

### Non-Linear Conversions
- Temperature conversions use addition/subtraction formulas, not simple multiplication  
- Requires special handling in `Quantity.convertTo()` for `TemperatureUnit`  
- Fundamentally different from length, weight, and volume (which are linear)  

### Absolute vs. Relative Temperatures
- Absolute temperature: 100°C is a specific point on a scale  
- Arithmetic on absolute temperatures is physically meaningless  
- Subtraction of two temperatures gives a *difference* — which is a different concept  

### Capability-Based Design
- Query units about supported operations before attempting them  
- Graceful degradation with clear, informative error messages  
- More user-friendly than silent failures or cryptic exceptions  

### Exception Semantics
- `UnsupportedOperationException` — operation not available for this category  
- `IllegalArgumentException` — invalid argument provided  
- `ArithmeticException` — mathematical error (e.g., division by zero)  
- Each exception type communicates a distinct kind of failure  

### Backward Compatibility Through Defaults
- Existing units (`LengthUnit`, `WeightUnit`, `VolumeUnit`) require zero changes  
- Default `() -> true` lambda and no-op `validateOperationSupport()` preserve current behavior  
- Refactoring is purely additive and non-breaking  

---
## Implementation Steps

### Step 1 – Refactor IMeasurable Interface
- Add `SupportsArithmetic` `@FunctionalInterface` with `boolean isSupported()`  
- Add default `SupportsArithmetic supportsArithmetic = () -> true`  
- Add `default boolean supportsArithmetic()` returning `supportsArithmetic.isSupported()`  
- Add `default void validateOperationSupport(String operation)` as no-op  

### Step 2 – No Changes to LengthUnit, WeightUnit, VolumeUnit
- All three inherit default `supportsArithmetic = () -> true`  
- `validateOperationSupport()` default no-op applies — all operations allowed  

### Step 3 – Create TemperatureUnit Enum
- Define `CELSIUS`, `FAHRENHEIT` constants  
- Assign lambda conversion functions per constant  
- Set `SupportsArithmetic supportsArithmetic = () -> false`  
- Override `validateOperationSupport()` to throw `UnsupportedOperationException`  
- Implement `convertToBaseUnit()` and `convertFromBaseUnit()` using formula lambdas  

### Step 4 – Update Quantity Class
- Equality: works as-is via `convertToBaseUnit()`  
- Conversion: check if unit is `TemperatureUnit`; if so, invoke non-linear formula directly  
- Arithmetic: call `this.unit.validateOperationSupport(operation.name())` before processing  

### Step 5 – Update QuantityMeasurementApp
- No changes to existing demonstration methods  
- Add temperature equality, conversion, and unsupported operation demonstrations in `main()`  

### Step 6 – Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Equality across all temperature unit pairs  
- Conversion accuracy with epsilon tolerance  
- Unsupported operation exception handling  
- Cross-category prevention  
- Edge cases: absolute zero, -40° equal point, large values  

---

## Conclusion
UC14 is the most architecturally significant use case since UC10 — it reveals a real-world limitation of the existing design and resolves it through principled refactoring rather than workarounds.

By introducing the `SupportsArithmetic` functional interface and `validateOperationSupport()` default method, the system achieves:
- **Interface Segregation** — categories implement only what they genuinely support  
- **Fail-fast safety** — unsupported operations rejected immediately with clear messages  
- **Non-breaking evolution** — existing units require zero changes  
- **Lambda-powered conversions** — non-linear temperature formulas expressed cleanly  
- **Full backward compatibility** — all UC1–UC13 tests pass without modification  

UC14 demonstrates that **great systems evolve gracefully** — accommodating new, structurally different requirements without breaking existing contracts or duplicating defensive code throughout the codebase.

# UC15: N-Tier Architecture Refactoring

## Overview

UC15 refactors the monolithic Quantity Measurement Application into a professional **N-Tier architecture** by separating concerns into distinct layers: Controller Layer, Service Layer, and Entity/Model Layer. This architectural shift transforms the standalone application from a single-responsibility class into a scalable, maintainable system that adheres to SOLID principles and industry best practices.

The refactoring redistributes responsibilities as follows:

- **Application Layer** (`QuantityMeasurementApp.Console`)
  - Entry point of the application
  - Handles user interaction via Menu
  - Invokes Controller methods

- **Controller Layer** (`Controller`)
  - Acts as mediator between UI and business logic
  - Accepts user input and converts it into DTOs
  - Calls Service layer methods

- **Business Layer** (`QuantityMeasurementAppBusinessLayer`)
  - Contains core business rules
  - Validates inputs and measurement types
  - Delegates persistence to Repository Layer

- **Repository Layer** (`QuantityMeasurementAppRepositoryLayer`)
  - Handles data storage and retrieval
  - Implements caching mechanism (Singleton)
  - Abstracted via interface for flexibility

- **Model Layer** (`QuantityMeasurementAppModelLayer`)
  - Defines DTOs, Enums, and Entities
  - Shared across all layers
---

## Objective

## Disadvantages of UC14 Addressed

| UC14 Limitation | UC15 Solution |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Mixed responsibilities in a single class | Clear 4-tier architecture with single-responsibility layers |
| Business logic tightly coupled to presentation | Service layer has zero presentation concerns |
| No defined data contract between operations | `QuantityDTO` as standardized input/output contract |
| Testing business logic requires UI mocking | Service layer testable independently with no UI dependency |
| No reusability across different interfaces | Service layer reusable from CLI, REST API, GUI |
| Exception handling scattered throughout | Centralized in `QuantityMeasurementException` |
| No extension points for frameworks | DI-ready; can integrate with ASP.NET Core DI or Autofac without changes |

---

## Concepts Used

### N-Tier Architecture
- Application, Controller, Business, Repository, and Model layers with clear boundaries
- Each layer communicates only with the layer directly below it
- Enables independent development, testing, and scalability

Project Mapping:
- Application Layer → QuantityMeasurementApp.Console
- Controller Layer → Controller/QuantityMeasurementController.cs
- Business Layer → QuantityMeasurementAppBusinessLayer/Service
- Repository Layer → QuantityMeasurementAppRepositoryLayer/Cache
- Model Layer → QuantityMeasurementAppModelLayer (DTOs, Enums, Models)

---

### POCO and DTO Classes
- POCO: Plain Old C# Object — only properties, constructors, getters/setters
- DTO: Data Transfer Object — used to transfer data between layers

Used in project:
- QuantityDTO → used between Controller and Service
- QuantityMeasurementEntity → used for persistence/history in Repository
- Enums → LengthUnit, WeightUnit, VolumeUnit, TemperatureUnit

---

### Repository Pattern
- IQuantityMeasurementRepository abstracts persistence
- QuantityMeasurementCacheRepository provides in-memory storage

Benefits:
- Decouples business logic from storage
- Easy to replace with database implementation

---

### Singleton Design Pattern
- QuantityMeasurementCacheRepository is a Singleton
- Ensures one centralized instance for data storage

---

### Dependency Injection
- Controller receives Service via constructor
- Service receives Repository via constructor

Benefits:
- Loose coupling

# UC16: Database Integration with ADO.NET for Quantity Measurement Persistence

## Overview

UC16 extends the Quantity Measurement Application by introducing **persistent database storage through ADO.NET** (C# Data Access). Building upon the N-Tier architecture established in UC15, this use case implements a `QuantityMeasurementDatabaseRepository` class that replaces the in-memory `QuantityMeasurementCacheRepository` for long-term data persistence.

This use case also introduces a **professional MSBuild/NuGet project structure** with proper namespace organization, comprehensive test coverage, and automated database schema creation. The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility while providing the ability to switch between in-memory cache and database storage through dependency injection and factory patterns.

---

## Objective

- Restructure the project to follow .NET standard directory layout with `.csproj`
- Organize classes into namespaces by layer: `Controller`, `Service`, `Repository`, `Entity`, `Exception`, `Unit`, `Util`
- Configure `.csproj` / `NuGet.config` with all required dependencies and build plugins
- Implement `QuantityMeasurementDatabaseRepository` using ADO.NET for full CRUD operations
- Implement `ApplicationConfig` for loading `appsettings.json` / `app.config`
- Implement `ConnectionPool` for efficient database connection management
- Create `DatabaseException` for database-specific error handling
- Create SQLite / H2Sharp database schema for development and testing
- Replace `Console.WriteLine` with NLog structured logging
- Write unit tests for Repository, Service, and Controller layers using MSTest / NUnit
- Write integration tests for end-to-end database persistence verification

---

## Features

- Full .NET project structure with MSBuild and NuGet package management
- ADO.NET-based `QuantityMeasurementDatabaseRepository` with `Save`, `FindAll`, `FindByOperation`, `FindByType`, `Count`, `DeleteAll`
- Custom `ConnectionPool` for reusable, thread-safe database connections
- `ApplicationConfig` class for environment-aware properties loading from `appsettings.json`
- SQLite for development and testing; SQL Server / PostgreSQL for production
- Parameterized SQL queries preventing SQL injection
- Transaction management ensuring data consistency
- NLog structured logging throughout all layers
- `DatabaseException` extending `QuantityMeasurementException`
- Enhanced `IQuantityMeasurementRepository` with query methods, count, deleteAll, pool statistics, and resource release
- Unit tests: `QuantityMeasurementDatabaseRepositoryTest`, `QuantityMeasurementServiceTest`, `QuantityMeasurementControllerTest`
- Integration tests: `QuantityMeasurementIntegrationTest`

## Disadvantages of UC15 Addressed

| UC15 Limitation | UC16 Solution |
|-----------------|---------------|
| In-memory cache lost on application crash | ADO.NET database provides durable, crash-safe persistence |
| Serialized file not scalable or human-readable | Relational database with SQL queryable by any tool |
| No concurrent access support | Connection pool handles multiple threads safely |
| No filtering or aggregation capabilities | SQL queries support filtering by operation type, measurement type, count, etc. |
| No schema enforcement on stored data | Database schema with typed columns and constraints |
| Difficult to inspect stored data externally | Any SQL client can query the database directly |
| No integration with enterprise tools | ADO.NET standard connects to BI tools, reporting engines, monitoring systems |
| Testing tied to file system state | SQLite in-memory database creates clean isolated test state per test run |

---

## Concepts Used

### .NET Project Structure
- Standard directory hierarchy with `.csproj`
- Namespace organization by architectural layer
- NuGet package management for dependencies

### ADO.NET (C# Data Access)
- Low-level, vendor-neutral database access API
- Explicit management of `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand` (`DbCommand`), and `SqlDataReader` (`DbDataReader`)
- `using` statements ensure all resources are automatically disposed

### Connection Pooling
- `ConnectionPool` maintains a pool of pre-created, reusable database connections
- Reduces overhead of opening and closing connections per operation
- Thread-safe with `lock` statements for acquiring and releasing connections
- Configurable pool size, timeout, and idle connection management

### Parameterized SQL Queries
- All SQL uses `@param` placeholders via `SqlCommand.Parameters`
- Separates SQL structure from user-supplied data
- Eliminates SQL injection vulnerabilities entirely

### Transaction Management
- Multiple related operations wrapped in a single atomic transaction
- `connection.BeginTransaction()` with explicit `Commit()` or `Rollback()`
- Ensures all-or-nothing semantics for data consistency

### Configuration Management
- `ApplicationConfig` reads from `appsettings.json` using `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`
- Supports environment-specific overrides via environment variables
- Centralizes all configuration — no hardcoded connection strings in code

### Custom Exception Hierarchy
- `DatabaseException` extends `QuantityMeasurementException`
- Wraps low-level `SqlException` with meaningful domain-level messages
- Propagates to service layer without exposing ADO.NET internals

### Database Schema Design
- `quantity_measurement_entity` table stores all operation records
- `quantity_measurement_history` table provides audit trail
- Indexes on frequently queried columns for performance
- Timestamps track when operations occurred

### NLog Structured Logging
- Replaces all `Console.WriteLine` calls with `Logger.Info()`, `Logger.Error()`, etc.
- NLog configuration in `nlog.config` controls log levels and output targets
- Structured logs improve debugging, monitoring, and production observability

### SQLite In-Memory Database for Testing
- Lightweight, zero-configuration database for unit and integration tests
- Schema auto-created from `schema.sql` before each test run
- Completely isolated from production database — no test data pollution

### Repository Interface Enhancement
- `IQuantityMeasurementRepository` extended with:
  - `GetMeasurementsByOperation(string operationType)`
  - `GetMeasurementsByType(string measurementType)`
  - `GetTotalCount()`
  - `DeleteAll()`
  - `GetPoolStatistics()` (default interface method)
  - `ReleaseResources()` (default interface method)

---

## Build Commands

```bash
dotnet restore                                              # Restore NuGet packages

## Disadvantages of UC16 Addressed

| UC16 Limitation | UC17 Solution |
|-----------------|---------------|
| No HTTP API exposure | ASP.NET Core WebAPI exposes all operations as REST endpoints |
| Raw ADO.NET requires verbose boilerplate SQL | Entity Framework Core with LINQ eliminates raw SQL |
| No standard API contract documentation | Swagger / OpenAPI auto-generates interactive API docs |
| No event-driven decoupling | Pub-Sub pattern decouples operation publishers from consumers |
| Read and write logic mixed in service layer | CQRS cleanly separates Query (read) and Command (write) paths |
| No user identity or session management | ASP.NET Core Identity provides full user management and sessions |
| Console logging only | NLog provides structured, configurable, multi-target logging |

---

## Concepts Used

### ASP.NET Core WebAPI
- Lightweight, high-performance framework for building HTTP services
- Built-in dependency injection container (`IServiceCollection`)
- Middleware pipeline for request/response processing
- Attribute-based routing: `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, `[Route]`

### RESTful Service Design
- Resource-based URL design: `/api/quantity`
- HTTP verbs map to operations: `GET` for queries, `POST` for commands
- Stateless communication — no server-side session state for API calls
- Standardized JSON request/response bodies via `System.Text.Json`

### MVC Pattern
- **Model**: `QuantityDTO`, `QuantityModel`, `QuantityMeasurementEntity`
- **View**: JSON responses (API — no HTML views)
- **Controller**: `QuantityMeasurementController` routes requests to service layer

### Minimal APIs (ASP.NET Core)
- Lightweight endpoint definition without full controller classes
- `app.MapGet()`, `app.MapPost()` for route registration
- Suitable for microservice-style endpoints

### Entity Framework Core
- ORM mapping C# classes to database tables
- `DbContext` manages database connection and change tracking
- `DbSet<T>` represents a database table
- LINQ to Entities: type-safe queries compiled to SQL
- Code-first Migrations: schema changes tracked and applied via `dotnet ef migrations add`

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **Commands**: Write operations — `AddQuantityCommand`, `ConvertQuantityCommand`
- **Queries**: Read operations — `GetAllMeasurementsQuery`, `GetMeasurementsByTypeQuery`
- Separates read and write models for scalability and clarity
- Handlers process commands and queries independently

### LINQ
- Language-Integrated Query syntax for collections and databases
- `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `GroupBy` used throughout service and repository layers
- Strongly typed — compile-time query validation

### Pub-Sub Pattern
- `MeasurementPerformedEvent` published after every operation
- Subscribers can independently react (logging, notifications, analytics)
- Decouples event producers from consumers

### ASP.NET Core Identity
- Built-in user management: registration, login, roles
- Session management for authenticated users
- Integration with WebAPI for protected endpoints

### WebAPI Filters
- `ActionFilter`: runs before/after controller actions (validation, logging)
- `ExceptionFilter`: centralized exception handling and error response formatting
- `AuthorizationFilter`: enforces access control rules

### StyleCop / Roslyn Analyzers
- Static code analysis enforcing C# coding style conventions
- Ensures consistent naming, spacing, and documentation across the codebase
- Integrated into the build pipeline — style violations treated as build warnings or errors

### MSTest
- Microsoft's unit testing framework for .NET
- `[TestClass]`, `[TestMethod]`, `[TestInitialize]`, `[TestCleanup]` attributes
- Assertions via `Assert.AreEqual`, `Assert.IsNotNull`, `Assert.ThrowsException`

### NLog
- Structured logging framework for .NET
- Configurable targets: file, console, database
- Log levels: Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal
- Replaces `Console.WriteLine` throughout all layers

### Swagger / OpenAPI
- Auto-generates interactive API documentation from controller annotations
- Accessible at `/swagger` — test endpoints directly from the browser
- `[ProducesResponseType]` attributes document response types and status codes

### Postman
- GUI tool for manually testing REST API endpoints
- Collections for organizing and running multiple API tests
- Environment variables for switching between dev/test/prod configurations
- Automated test scripts with `pm.test()` assertions

---

# UC18: .NET Security — JWT, OAuth 2.0, Encryption and Hashing

## Overview

UC18 secures the ASP.NET Core REST API built in UC17 by implementing industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms. This use case introduces **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless API authentication, **OAuth 2.0** for delegated authorization flows, **encryption and decryption** for protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit, and **hashing algorithms** for secure password storage.

Security is not an afterthought — UC18 integrates these mechanisms as foundational middleware layers that protect every endpoint in the Quantity Measurement API.

---

## Objective

- Implement JWT-based authentication for stateless API security
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization flows for delegated access
- Secure all REST API endpoints with `[Authorize]` attribute and JWT bearer tokens
- Implement encryption and decryption for sensitive data
- Implement hashing algorithms for secure password storage
- Add token refresh, expiry, and revocation mechanisms
- Apply security best practices: HTTPS enforcement, CORS policy, rate limiting
- Extend MSTest suite with security-focused test cases

---

## Features

- JWT generation with claims (user ID, roles, expiry)
- JWT validation middleware in ASP.NET Core pipeline
- OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow and client credentials flow
- `[Authorize]` and `[AllowAnonymous]` attributes on controller endpoints
- Role-based access control (RBAC) using JWT claims
- Symmetric encryption (AES-256) for sensitive data at rest
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA) for secure key exchange
- BCrypt password hashing with salt
- SHA-256 and SHA-512 hashing for data integrity verification
- Token refresh endpoint with refresh token rotation
- HTTPS enforcement middleware
- CORS policy configuration
- Rate limiting middleware to prevent brute-force attacks
- Security headers: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`

---

## Disadvantages of UC17 Addressed

| UC17 Limitation | UC18 Solution |
|-----------------|---------------|
| All endpoints publicly accessible — no authentication | JWT bearer token required for all protected endpoints |
| Passwords stored without hashing | BCrypt adaptive hashing with salt applied to all passwords |
| Sensitive data stored in plain text | AES-256 encryption applied to sensitive fields at rest |
| No authorization — any authenticated user can do anything | Role-based and policy-based access control via JWT claims |
| No protection against brute-force login attacks | Rate limiting middleware blocks excessive authentication attempts |
| Tokens never expire or get revoked | Short-lived JWT + refresh token rotation with revocation support |
| No transport security enforcement | HTTPS redirection and HSTS headers enforced |

## Concepts Used

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Three-part structure: `Header.Payload.Signature`
- **Header**: algorithm and token type (`HS256`, `RS256`)
- **Payload**: claims — `sub` (user ID), `role`, `exp` (expiry), `iat` (issued at), custom claims
- **Signature**: HMAC-SHA256 or RSA signature ensuring token integrity
- Stateless: server validates token without a database lookup on every request
- `JwtSecurityTokenHandler` from `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt` for generation and validation

### OAuth 2.0
- Authorization framework for delegated access
- **Authorization Code Flow**: user authenticates with identity provider; app receives authorization code exchanged for access token
- **Client Credentials Flow**: machine-to-machine authentication without user interaction
- **Scopes**: define what resources the token grants access to (`read:measurements`, `write:measurements`)
- Integration with ASP.NET Core Identity and external providers

### REST API Security
- `[Authorize]` attribute on controllers/actions requires valid JWT bearer token
- `[AllowAnonymous]` on login and registration endpoints
- Role-based: `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`
- Policy-based: `[Authorize(Policy = "MeasurementWriter")]`
- JWT bearer token passed in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP header

### Encryption and Decryption
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: symmetric encryption for sensitive stored data
  - 256-bit key, CBC mode with random IV
  - `Aes.Create()` in `System.Security.Cryptography`
- **RSA**: asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange and digital signatures
  - Public key encrypts; private key decrypts
  - `RSA.Create()` in `System.Security.Cryptography`

### Hashing Algorithms
- **BCrypt**: adaptive password hashing with built-in salt
  - `BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword(password)` — stores hash + salt together
  - `BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.Verify(password, hash)` — validates without knowing salt separately
  - Work factor configurable — increases cost as hardware improves
- **SHA-256 / SHA-512**: cryptographic hash functions for data integrity
  - One-way: cannot reverse hash to original input
  - Deterministic: same input always produces same hash
  - Used for API request signing, file integrity, audit logs
  - `SHA256.Create()` / `SHA512.Create()` in `System.Security.Cryptography`

### Token Refresh and Rotation
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) + long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- Refresh token stored securely (hashed) in database
- Token rotation: each refresh issues a new refresh token and invalidates the old one
- Prevents refresh token theft from granting indefinite access

### Security Middleware
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: `app.UseHttpsRedirection()` — redirects all HTTP to HTTPS
- **HSTS**: `app.UseHsts()` — instructs browsers to only use HTTPS
- **CORS Policy**: `app.UseCors()` — restricts which origins can call the API
- **Rate Limiting**: `app.UseRateLimiter()` (built-in .NET 7+) or custom middleware limiting requests per IP per time window
- **Security Headers**: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy`

### Security Best Practices Applied
- Never store plain-text passwords — always BCrypt hash
- Never log JWT tokens or sensitive claims
- Validate all input before processing (prevent injection)
- Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for secrets — never hardcode in `appsettings.json`
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Principle of least privilege: tokens carry only necessary claims

## Security Endpoints

### Auth API

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                          | Auth Required |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| POST   | /api/auth/register | Register new user                    | No            |
| POST   | /api/auth/login    | Login user (returns JWT token)       | No            |

### Quantity Measurement APIs

| Method | Endpoint                                           | Description                              | Auth Required |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| POST   | /api/quantity/compare                              | Compare two quantities                   | Yes (JWT)     |
| POST   | /api/quantity/add                                  | Add two quantities                       | Yes (JWT)     |
| POST   | /api/quantity/subtract                             | Subtract quantities                      | Yes (JWT)     |
| POST   | /api/quantity/divide                               | Divide quantities                        | Yes (JWT)     |
| POST   | /api/quantity/convert                              | Convert quantity between units           | Yes (JWT)     |
| GET    | /api/quantity/history                              | Get all operation history                | Yes (JWT)     |

## Implementation Steps

1. **Configure JWT Settings** — Add `JwtSettings` to `appsettings.json`: `SecretKey`, `Issuer`, `Audience`, `ExpiryMinutes`; register with Options pattern in DI
2. **Implement JwtTokenService** — `GenerateAccessToken(user)`, `ValidateToken(token)`, `GenerateRefreshToken()`
3. **Register JWT Bearer Authentication** — `builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme).AddJwtBearer(...)`; add `app.UseAuthentication()` and `app.UseAuthorization()`
4. **Create AuthController** — `POST /register`, `POST /login`, `POST /refresh`, `POST /revoke`
5. **Secure Existing Endpoints** — Add `[Authorize]` to `QuantityMeasurementController`; add role-based policies
6. **Implement Encryption and Hashing Services** — `EncryptionService` (AES-256); `HashingService` (SHA-256, BCrypt wrapper)
7. **Add Security Middleware** — `SecurityHeadersMiddleware`, `RateLimitingMiddleware`; register in `Program.cs`
8. **Configure OAuth 2.0** — Register OAuth 2.0 provider; implement client credentials flow
9. **Write Security Tests** — JWT generation/validation, BCrypt hashing, 401/403 responses, rate limiting, token refresh
